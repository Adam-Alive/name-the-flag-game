# [NAME THE FLAG GAME](https://adam-alive.github.io/name-the-flag-game)

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a simple and intuitive quiz-game where users can test their knowledge of world flags.

Users will be able to navigate the game with minimal instructions, enjoying a clean and uncluttered design.

For each question, a flag image will appear on screen and users can choose a country from one of three buttons. The button clicked will turn green if correct and red if incorrect, with the correct button turning green to enable learning by the user.

There are 20 questions and a running score is shown along with the total score at the game's completion.

Users can reset the game at any time, both during play and at the end to start a new game.

## Target Audience

The target audience is children and adults who will be able to enjoy testing their knowledge and learn more about world flags.

## UX

### Initial Design

This image shows the initial game design, drafted in Word, incorporating all stages of the game summarised above, and which will be hidden/unhidden as the game progresses.

![Initial Design](documentation/initial-design.png)

I chose 20 as the number of questions in order to give the user a sense of 'building up' during the game and to increase their learning opportunities.

### Colour Scheme

In keeping with the simplicity of the game, I wanted to use minimal background colours so chose white and a light blue, also conscious that the flags are the game's focus and should not be crowded out by other colours.

A darker blue seemed appropriate for the answer buttons with a slightly lighter shade for the navigation buttons. These colours then reverse when the mouse is hovered-over to indicate the button is active. I chose a green and red of similar tone to these blues for the correct and incorrect answer buttons respectively. I used the [W3 RGB calculator](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp) to select colours, and their use is summarised below:

- `rgb(10, 13, 17)` used for primary text.
- `rgb(255, 255, 255)` used for inner game-area and text on buttons.
- `rgb(176, 196, 222)` used for outer game-area.
- `rgb(61, 61, 245)` used for answer buttons.
- `rgb(34, 135, 202)` used for game navigation buttons.
- `rgb(0, 128, 0)` used for correct answer buttons (a universal green for go/correct!)
- `rgb(255, 0, 0)` used for incorrect answer buttons (a universal red for stop/incorrect!)

### Typography

- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) has been used for all text.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Home Page**
  - The user is greeted by a colourful and eye-catching globe-shaped collage of flags. A brief welcome message invites the user to learn and have fun and the start button provides a clear call to action.

- **Game Start**
  - A flag-image is shown with three answer buttons giving the user a choice of three countries. Above the flag is displayed the current question number (out of 20) and current score.

![screenshot](documentation/game-start.png)

- **Correct Answer and Next Question**
  - The user has selected the correct answer-button which causes it to turn green and the other two buttons to turn red. The score tally increments by one and the next and restart buttons will allow the user to go to the next question or restart the game if they wish.

- **Wrong Answer and Restart**
  - The user has selected the wrong answer-button which causes it to turn red, along with the other wrong answer. The correct answer-button turns green so the user will be able to learn the correct flag. Play continues until 20 questions have been answered or the user restarts the game.

- **Total Score and Play Again**
  - After question 20 is answered, a total score message is displayed and the user can start a new game if they wish by clicking on the play again button.

![screenshot](documentation/total-score.png)

- **New Game**
  - The game is reset with a new flag on display, the question tally at 1/20 and the score at 0.

### Future Features

The following features would add to the user experience in future:

- Encouraging Alert
  - A pop-up alert after 10 questions have been answered to encourage the user to keep going e.g. "Half-way there, keep going!"
- Full Score Message
  - A score of 20/20 could display a fun and congratulatory message, perhaps with an animation or video with flags flying or a large crowd waving flags.
- Fun Facts
  - After each correct answer, a message displays the name of the correct country's capital city e.g. "Did you know that the capital of Venezuela is Caracas?"
